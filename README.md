## User Details Form
This project is a simple React application that allows users to submit their details using a form. The form includes fields for first name, last name, country, city, gender, and phone number. The user's details are then submitted to a local server endpoint (http://localhost:3000/users) using a POST request and saved in a `db.json` file.
